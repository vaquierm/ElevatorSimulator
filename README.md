# Elevator Simulator üè¢

This project is a modular simulation of an elevator system inside of a building.
The configuration of the building can be changed freely to run the simulation in different types of buildings with different number of elevators etc...

This project intends on exploring different strategies for the elevators to pick up and drop off requests and tracks three metrics to judge their performances.

A smart relocation that relocates idle elevator dynamically to the give maximum coverage of the building based on requests of the last half hour.
This is a trade-off that can reduce the waiting time of passengers but increase the energy used by the elevator system.

Another strategy used is to give the elevator information about where the destination floor of a request is before the passenger is even picked up. This way, the elevator system can make more complicated decisions since it knows where everyone is going before they even get in the elevator.

## Metrics tracked

**1. Waiting time** ‚åö

This is the average time that someone waits from the moment they press the button to request the elevator to the moment the elevator doors open.

**2. Travel time** ‚úà

This is the average time that someone spends inside the elevator from the moment they step in to the moment the doors open allowing them to leave.

**3. Floors traveled** üìè

This is the average number of floors that the elevator travels to complete one request.

This number will therefore account for the floors traveled while the elevator could be empty on its way to service a request. And if multiple people are in the same elevator, this "cost" is distributed amongst them.

## How accurate is the simulation

The good! üëç

- Distribution of residents per floor is taken into account (Less people live on penthouse floors)
- Request source and destinations are weighted by the floor "interest" (There is a much higher chance that requests come from or go to the ground floor or floors with amenities)
- Day cycles are taken into account (In the morning, people are going to work so requests tend to down to the ground floor and around 5 there is a spike of requests from the ground floor to the apartments after work)

The bad... üëé
- Acceleration of elevators is not taken into account
- Assumption that when a request is made, it is always just one person
- Capacity of elevators is not taken into account (They can accommodate as many passengers as needed)
- Assumption that nobody accidently presses more than their destination floor

## Different AIs

Two different elevator AI's have been implemented: a baseline, and an optimized version

### Regular AI

A standard elevator AI from my observations in my apartment building.

The logic is simple:
 - If there are some idle elevators, the closest one is assigned to go service the request.
 - If there are no idle elevators, check if any busy elevator could service the request on its way. If there exist any of these elevators, the closest one should service the request.
 - If neither of the above conditions are true, continue the simulation until the request can be serviced.
 
### Optimized AI

The optimized AI is given information about where the destination floor of the requests are without having to pick up the passenger.

The decision making follows this penalty minimization logic:

````
for each elevator
  if elevator idle
    penalty = wait time
  else if request on the way
    penalty = wait time + loading time (number of people waiting for and in this elevator)
  else
    penalty = time the elevator will take to service its current requests and come back
  
chose the option with the least penalty
````

## Smart relocation

The smart relocation is a plugin system that can be plugged to any elevator AI. It tracks the distribution of requests that were made in the last half hour.
When an elevator is done servicing all its requests and becomes idle, it calculates its most optimal positioning in the building relative to the other elevators such that the waiting time for any new request is minimized (weighted by floor based on probability).
The probability distribution for new requests is approximated by the distribution that was tracked over the last half hour.
